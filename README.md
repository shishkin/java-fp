## Code

Code is organized as a series of refactoring steps from the first imperative loop version ([src/test/org/shishkin/fp/A_Loop.java](src/test/org/shishkin/fp/A_Loop.java)) into a fully FP-style version utilizing Java 8 Stream API ([src/test/org/shishkin/fp/G_Streams.java](src/test/org/shishkin/fp/G_Streams.java)).
